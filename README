Enjoy!!

Note:
  When multibyte character is troubled.
  Standard curses library of Ruby doesn't correspond to UTF-8.
  Please apply the patch to correspond to ncursesw referring to the following sites.

  http://www.itline.jp/~svx/diary/?date=20091022

  In experimentally, Mave corresponds terminal environment of EUC-JP now.
  In this case, you do not need to apply above patch.
  Set EUC-JP to ':TERMINAL_CHARSET' in mave.config, and change mave_base.rb a bit.
  "export LANG=ja_JP.eucjp" might execute from the terminal.

  117     def enspc
  118 #       return(self)                                            # comment out without UTF-8
  119 ^       self.gsub(/[\xC0-\xE2][\x80-\xBF]+/) {|c|               #### for UTF8 temporally
      +-remove this '#'

  And in experimentally, Mave is corresponding Windows console environment with SHIFT_JIS.
  Set SHIFT_JIS to ':TERMINAL_CHARSET' in mave.config, and try and error.
